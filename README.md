A lightweight, secure sandbox for running Linux processes using the Linux kernel's [Landlock LSM](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html), implemented in Rust with the excellent [`landlock-rs`](https://docs.rs/landlock/latest/landlock/) crate.

**rstrict** leverages the Linux **Landlock** security module to sandbox processes, allowing you to run commands with restricted access to the filesystem and network, reducing the potential impact of vulnerabilities or unintended actions.


For detailed information about the underlying Landlock security module, see the [official Linux kernel documentation](https://docs.kernel.org/userspace-api/landlock.html).

Quote:
>The goal of Landlock is to enable restriction of ambient rights (e.g. global filesystem or network access) for a set of processes. Because Landlock is a stackable LSM, it makes it possible to create safe security sandboxes as new security layers in addition to the existing system-wide access-controls. This kind of sandbox is expected to help mitigate the security impact of bugs or unexpected/malicious behaviors in user space applications. Landlock empowers any process, including unprivileged ones, to securely restrict themselves.

> The two existing types of rules are:

> Filesystem rules
> For these rules, the object is a file hierarchy, and the related filesystem actions are defined with filesystem access rights.

>Network rules (since ABI v4)
> For these rules, the object is a TCP port, and the related actions are defined with network access rights.
-- Landlock

## Quick Start Examples

The basic command structure is:

```bash
rstrict [OPTIONS] -- <COMMAND> [COMMAND_ARGS...]
```

Example Sandboxing
```bash
# allow `ls` and its linked libraries to run, allow access to read /tmp
rstrict --log-level debug --ro /tmp --ldd --add-exec -- ls -l /tmp 


# Curl sandbox example
# --add-exec Allow executing curl binary (optional helper)
# --ldd Allow executing curl's libraries (optional helper)
# --ro Read DNS configuration
# --ro Read Name service configuration
# --ro Read Hosts file
# --ro Read SSL certificates
# --connect-tcp <port> Allow connections to HTTP Port
rstrict --log-level info \
        --add-exec \
        --ldd \
        --ro /etc/resolv.conf \
        --ro /etc/nsswitch.conf \
        --ro /etc/hosts \
        --ro /etc/ssl/certs \
        --connect-tcp 443 \
        -- \
        curl https://example.com
```
** If pass --rox for the binary to exec and any linked libraries then optional --ldd and --add-exec helpers may be removed. 


## Security Model

rstrict follows the fundamental security principle of "deny by default, allow explicitly." When a process is sandboxed with rstrict:

1. **Default Denial**: All handled Landlock operations are denied unless explicitly allowed by rules
2. **Inheritance**: Restrictions automatically apply to child processes
3. **Accumulation**: New rules can only add restrictions, never remove them
4. **Least Privilege**: Target only required resources with minimal permissions

## Features and Landlock Mapping

rstrict provides user-friendly flags that directly map to Landlock's underlying access control mechanisms:

| **Feature Type** | **rstrict Flags** | **Landlock Access Rights** | **Available Since** |
|------------------|-------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|
| **Filesystem Access** | | | |
| | `--ro <PATH>` | `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE`, `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR` (applied to PATH; recursively if PATH is a directory) | ABI v1 |
| | `--rw <PATH>` | `--ro` rights + `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE`, `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE`, etc. (applied to PATH; recursively if PATH is a directory) | ABI v1+ |
| | `--rox <PATH>` | `--ro` rights + `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE` (applied to PATH; recursively if PATH is a directory) | ABI v1 |
| | `--rwx <PATH>` | `--rw` rights + `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE` (applied to PATH; recursively if PATH is a directory) | ABI v1 |
| **Network Control** | | | |
| | `--bind-tcp <PORT>` | `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP` | ABI v4+ |
| | `--connect-tcp <PORT>` | `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP` | ABI v4+ |
| **Helper Functions** | | | |
| | `--add-exec` | Automatically adds command executable to `--rox` | N/A |
| | `--ldd` | Automatically adds libraries to `--rox` | N/A |
| | `--env` | Environment variable management | N/A |

### Filesystem Access Controls

rstrict's filesystem flags provide intuitive access control that maps to Landlock's more granular permissions:

- **`--ro <PATH>`**: Allow read-only access to the specified path
  - If PATH is a directory: Permissions apply recursively to all files/directories beneath it
  - If PATH is a file: Permissions apply only to that specific file
  - Maps to `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_FILE` and `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_READ_DIR`
  - Example use: Configuration files, static assets

- **`--rw <PATH>`**: Allow read-write access to the specified path
  - If PATH is a directory: Read-write permissions apply recursively to all files/directories beneath it
  - If PATH is a file: Read-write permissions apply only to that specific file
  - Includes all `--ro` rights plus write operations like:
    - `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_WRITE_FILE`
    - `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE` (ABI v3+)
    - `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_FILE`/`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REMOVE_DIR`
    - `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_REG`/`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_MAKE_DIR`, etc.
  - Example use: Log directories, temp folders

- **`--rox <PATH>`**: Allow read and execute access to the specified path
  - If PATH is a directory: Read-execute permissions apply recursively to all files/directories beneath it
  - If PATH is a file: Read-execute permissions apply only to that specific file
  - Includes `--ro` rights plus `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_EXECUTE`
  - Example use: System libraries, binaries, scripts

- **`--rwx <PATH>`**: Allow read, write, and execute access to the specified path
  - If PATH is a directory: Read-write-execute permissions apply recursively to all files/directories beneath it
  - If PATH is a file: Read-write-execute permissions apply only to that specific file
  - Combines `--rw` and `--rox` permissions
  - Example use: Application working directories needing full access

### Network Access Controls

rstrict's network flags directly correspond to Landlock's TCP socket controls (available since ABI v4):

- **`--bind-tcp <PORT>`**: Allow binding to the specified TCP port
  - Maps to `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_BIND_TCP`
  - Example use: Web servers, database services

- **`--connect-tcp <PORT>`**: Allow outgoing TCP connections to the specified port
  - Maps to `LANDLOCK_ACCESS_NET_CONNECT_TCP`
  - Example use: API clients, web scrapers

**Important Note:** Landlock network rules currently **only restrict TCP** bind/connect operations. **UDP, ICMP, and other protocols are NOT restricted** by these rules.

### Helper Flags

rstrict provides convenience flags to simplify common sandboxing tasks:

- **`--add-exec`**: Automatically find `<COMMAND>` in `$PATH` and add it to the `--rox` list
  - Saves you from having to manually locate and specify the executable path

- **`--ldd`**: Run `ldd` on `<COMMAND>` to find and add shared library dependencies
  - Automatically discovers and adds libraries with appropriate execute permissions
  - Adds common system library directories (like `/lib`, `/usr/lib`) to the `--rox` list

- **`--env <VAR>`**: Manage environment variables for the sandboxed process
  - `--env KEY=VALUE`: Sets an environment variable
  - `--env KEY`: Inherits a value from the current environment

## Usage

The basic command structure is:

```bash
rstrict [OPTIONS] -- <COMMAND> [COMMAND_ARGS...]
```
The basic command structure is:

```bash
rstrict [OPTIONS] -- <COMMAND> [COMMAND_ARGS...]
```

*   `[OPTIONS]`: Flags to configure the sandbox rules (see table above).
*   `--`: **Required:** Separates `rstrict` options from the command you want to run.
*   `<COMMAND>`: The command to execute inside the sandbox.
*   `[COMMAND_ARGS...]`: Arguments for the command being executed.

### Options

**Filesystem Access:**

*   `--ro <PATH>`: Allow read-only access to the specified path. If PATH is a directory, permissions apply recursively to everything beneath it. If PATH is a file, permissions apply only to that specific file. Can be used multiple times.
*   `--rw <PATH>`: Allow read-write access to the specified path. If PATH is a directory, permissions apply recursively to everything beneath it. If PATH is a file, permissions apply only to that specific file. Can be used multiple times.
*   `--rox <PATH>`: Allow read + execute access to the specified path. If PATH is a directory, permissions apply recursively to everything beneath it. If PATH is a file, permissions apply only to that specific file. Can be used multiple times.
*   `--rwx <PATH>`: Allow read-write + execute access to the specified path. If PATH is a directory, permissions apply recursively to everything beneath it. If PATH is a file, permissions apply only to that specific file. Can be used multiple times.

**Network Access (TCP Only):**

*   `--bind-tcp <PORT>`: Allow binding to the specified TCP port. Can be used multiple times.
*   `--connect-tcp <PORT>`: Allow outgoing TCP connections to the specified port. Can be used multiple times.

**Helper Flags:**

*   `--add-exec`: Automatically find `<COMMAND>` in `$PATH` and add it to the `--rox` list.
*   `--ldd`: Run `ldd` on `<COMMAND>` to find shared library dependencies and add them to `--rox`.
*   `--env <VAR>`: Specify environment variables for the sandboxed process.
    *   `--env KEY=VALUE`: Sets the variable `KEY` to `VALUE`.
    *   `--env KEY`: Inherits the value of `KEY` from the current environment.

**Unrestricted Access:**

*   `--unrestricted-filesystem`: Disable Landlock filesystem rules.
*   `--unrestricted-network`: Disable Landlock network (TCP) rules.

**Logging & Meta:**

*   `--log-level <LEVEL>`: Set logging verbosity. Options: `error` (default), `warn`, `info`, `debug`, `trace`.
*   `--help`: Show help message and exit.
*   `--version`: Show version information and exit.

## How It Works

1. **Command Parsing**: rstrict processes command-line flags to build a sandboxing configuration
2. **Path Resolution**: Paths specified in flags are resolved to their absolute locations
3. **Library Discovery**: If `--ldd` is used, shared libraries are automatically discovered
4. **Ruleset Creation**: rstrict creates a Landlock ruleset with the specified access rights
5. **Rule Addition**: Each path/port rule is added to the ruleset with appropriate permissions
6. **Self-Restriction**: rstrict applies the ruleset to itself using Landlock's `restrict_self()`
7. **Command Execution**: rstrict uses `execvpe` to replace itself with the target command
8. **Inherited Restrictions**: The target command runs with the Landlock restrictions already in place

This approach ensures the security boundary is established before the target program begins execution.

## Examples

**1. Running `ls` with minimal read access:**

```bash
# Basic filesystem sandbox
rstrict --log-level info \
        --ro /home \
        --add-exec \
        --ldd \
        -- \
        ls -l /home
```
*Output should show details for `/bin/bash`. Trying `ls -l /tmp` would fail with a permission error.*

**2. Running `curl` to fetch a webpage (HTTPS):**

```bash
rstrict --log-level info \
        --add-exec \
        --ldd \
        --ro /etc/resolv.conf \
        --ro /etc/nsswitch.conf \
        --ro /etc/hosts \
        --ro /etc/ssl/certs \
        --connect-tcp 443 \
        -- \
        curl https://example.com
```

*   `--add-exec`, `--ldd`: Allow `curl` and its libraries to run
*   `--ro /etc/resolv.conf`, etc.: Allow DNS resolver configuration access
*   `--ro /etc/ssl/certs`: Allow TLS certificate verification
*   `--connect-tcp 443`: Allow HTTPS connections

**3. Allowing write access to a specific directory:**

```bash
# Create a temporary directory first
mkdir ./my_temp_data

# Run touch with write access to only that directory
rstrict --log-level info \
        --rw ./my_temp_data \
        --add-exec \
        --ldd \
        -- \
        touch ./my_temp_data/test_file.txt
```

**4. Running a web server on port 8080 can connect to MySQL on 3306:**

```bash
rstrict --log-level info \
        --ro /app/static \
        --rw /app/logs \
        --bind-tcp 8080 \
        --connect-tcp 3306 \
        --add-exec \
        --ldd \
        -- \
        /app/myserver --port 8080
```

## Landlock ABI Version Compatibility

rstrict adapts to the available Landlock features on your kernel at runtime. It will use the highest supported ABI version and adjust its behavior accordingly:

| ABI Version | Kernel | Features Added |
|-------------|--------|---------------|
| v1 | 5.13+ | Basic filesystem controls (read, write, execute) |
| v2 | 5.15+ | File linking/renaming between directories (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_REFER`) |
| v3 | 5.16+ | File truncation control (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_TRUNCATE`) |
| v4 | 5.19+ | TCP network controls (bind, connect) |
| v5 | 6.2+ | Device IOCTL control (`LANDLOCK_ACCESS_FS_IOCTL_DEV`) |
| v6 | 6.5+ | IPC scoping (signals, abstract UNIX sockets) |

## Limitations

*   **Linux Only**: Landlock is a Linux-specific kernel feature.
*   **Kernel Version**: Features depend on kernel support for specific Landlock ABIs.
*   **Network Restrictions (TCP Only)**: UDP, ICMP, etc. are not restricted.
*   **No UID/GID Changes**: rstrict does not change user or group IDs.
*   **Maximum Ruleset Layers**: Limited to 16 stacked rulesets per process.
